Bernard; I'm here, Cap!

Bernard; Thought I was a goner there! They almost got me!
Norman; So I'm guessing that means your cover was blown?
Bernard; Yep, sorry bout that. I think I dressed the part of a Sebresan Businessman well, though.
Norman; No worries. You made it to the rendez-vous and that's what matters.
Norman; So did you find an entrance?
Bernard; That I did! Though it might be a little difficult to get there with all the grunts looking for me.
Norman; We may just have to brute force our way through them. Are you ready for this?
Bernard; Not really...
Norman; Okay, great! Let's go, Berns!
