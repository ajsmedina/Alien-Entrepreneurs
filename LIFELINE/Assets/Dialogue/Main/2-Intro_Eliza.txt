Eliza; Don't worry, Aria and Ciel are with my sister.
Eliza; Sam was sick so I joined the pincer group who infiltrated the other side.

Bernard; So where's the group?

Eliza; ...

Bernard; Eliza?

Eliza; They're dead.

Norman; Dead?
Nomran; How...?

Eliza; There was... a strange girl.

Bernard; A squad of four veteran guards were taken down by a single enemy?

Eliza; I don't know how, but... she was strong.
Eliza; Norman, we have to get out of here.

Norman; Well, we can't exactly go back that way.

Bernard; It was the captain's fault.

Norman; So I guess we'll need to keep moving forward.
Norman; Maybe we can find the information we need deeper inside.

Eliza; Okay. But please, we must tread carefully.

Norman; Can you still fight?

Eliza; Yes. But if we see her, we run, OK?

Norman; Okay, Eliza. We'll be safe, don't worry.
