Cordea; Bernard!
Bernard; Yeah, Dea?
Cordea; Can you continue your story now?
Bernard; Huh?
Cordea; Y'know! You ran away and you met someone.
Cordea; Who was he?

Bernard; Oh, that. 
Bernard; Are Norman and Eliza... no they're off over there.
Bernard; Alright.

Cordea; Great!

Bernard; Well, he just happened to sit down on the bench beside me.
Bernard; Downright handsome... and charming...
Bernard; I'd be lying if I said I didn't start crushing on him right away.
Bernard; I guess the sadness on my face was plain as day because he asked me what was wrong.
Bernard; I explained everything to him. My Mystiks, my parents...
Bernard; How much I hated being useless.

Cordea; Bernard...

Bernard; He put his hand on my shoulder and looked me dead in the eyes.
Bernard; "You're not useless."
Bernard; This stranger just told me what I've wanted to hear my whole life.
Bernard; And I started bawling right there.
Bernard; He told me that I could use my abilities if I join the Foronian army. They never had enough Mystivers.
Bernard; So I did what he said, and now I have a reason to fight. To live. 
Bernard; I can use my powers to help keep Foron safe.
Bernard; I can use my powers to help keep <i>him</i> safe.
Bernard; I fight so I have a purpose. So that I can prove that I'm <i>not</i> useless.
Bernard; That man changed my life...
Bernard; I did eventually shake off that crush and, well...
Bernard; He's a good friend to me. I'd prefer nothing more.

Cordea; Who was he?

Bernard; Well, would you look at that! Eliza looks like she needs help!
