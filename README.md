Alien Entrepreneurs from the Wild Wild West

A co-operative puzzle-platformer made in Unity.

Play as a group of four aliens who crash landed in the Wild Wild West. The only part of your ship that works?
The machine that turns vegetables into hats. Work together to collect eggplants, create new hats, and raise enough
money to rebuild your ship and get back home!

This game is currently a proof of concept. 

There are currently 6 levels and 7 hats available, but no sense of progression or saving.

I am planning on adding more levels, a cinematic intro, a proper menu screen, music, animations,
and more hats! 

I am currently devoting my time on other projects, but I definitely want to pack this game up nicer and make it more
playable.
